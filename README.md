## Awards
üèÜ - 3rd Place Overall out of over 100+ original teams - Boilermake VII 

## Inspiration
The theme of Boilermake, "hack your own adventure" inspired us to build something similar to a choose your own adventure game. We realized that, while there are tools that do isolated tasks such as: finding cheap tickets, booking hotels, or searching for attractions, nothing combined all of these tools into a fun-to-use web-app. Thus, Adventurous Sloth was born.

## What it does
Adventure Sloth is a web app which allows a user to choose from several preferences and then generates a location to travel to with relevant travel info: (flight, hotel, attractions) as well as generating links to book your travel.

## How it Works
We used Express.js with Node.js for the backend and React and Javascript for the front end. The backend uses TripAdvisor and Skyscanner APIs via RapidAPIs to collect flight, hotel, and attraction data. The web-app is also hosted on the Google Cloud Platform via the App Engine.
